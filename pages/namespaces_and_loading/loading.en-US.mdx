## How it works

### Load Order:

- Defining an explicit load order is vital, and now mandatory for each awful project.
- If you've encountered `No awful-config.json` or `Missing awful-config` errors, keep reading.

### Immersion:

On load, awful immerses each file in an isolated bubble environment. Here are some things to note about it:

> - Most protected API, by direct reference, is unlocked and/or modified to be consistent between all supported unlockers - default reads/writes are NOT from `_G (global)` environment.
>
> - Each file is passed [common namespaces](namespaces#common-namespaces) as varargs to make use of our API and establish your own.

## Understanding Load Order

### Dependencies first

- You should plan an appropriate order for your files to load based on **dependencies** and **dependents**.. Here is a quick example:

#### .../project/**project.lua** (Dependency)

```lua
local unlocker, awful, project = ...

project.print = function(str) print("(epicProject) >", str) end
```

- This file **declares** `project.print` as a function when first loaded, setting up a function we can use to make prints from our project fancier!

#### .../project/mage/**fire.lua** (Dependent)

```lua
local unlocker, awful, project = ...
local mage = project.mage

-- routine actor
local fire = mage.fire

-- if player is not mage, stops code below from running
if not fire.ready then return end

-- Fancy Load Print!
project.print('Fire Mage Rotation Loaded')
```

- The above file **calls** `project.print`, the function we **declared** above, to print an OnLoad message for the mage rotation, as long as the player is on a mage. Note we declared and are accessing it through our [project's namespace](namespaces#project)

### Can you guess which one should load first?

In this example it's clearly `project.lua`, but with a huge project containing many more files, it could become a much harder question to answer!

- We first have to **declare** the `project.print` function (as well as the mage table, our routine actor, etc.) before **using** them in `fire.lua` ... Now you have to consider this for **your own personal project**. Your variables, api, file structure, etc. will be unique to you, and the **sooner** you consider your explicit load order the **better**.

## Configuring Load Order

### Creating `awful-config.json`

> Within your project's base directory ( awful/routines/**project** ), create a file named `awful-config.json`. You can assign a load order within this file. It must have either the `.json` or `.jsonc` extension, or it will not be recognized.

- The base directory is your project's base folder, ( awful/routines/**project** ). The load order is from top to bottom. Here is an example of the contents of a basic `awful-config` file

```json
{
    "load": [
        "awful.lua",
        "spells/mage/mage.lua",
        "spells/mage/fire.lua",
        "actors/mage/fire.lua"
    ]
}
```

> Now the listed files will be loaded from top-bottom.
>
> ⚠️ Important: **If you don't list a file in your load order, it won't be loaded by Awful.** Remember to always come back and add new files to your load order when you create them.

### Cleaning it up

- First, any file being loaded by awful will be of the `.lua` extension. You can omit these redundant file extensions from your awful-config if you want. Leading/traililng slashes will also be ignored.

```json
{
     "load": [
        "awful",
        "spells/mage/mage",
        "spells/mage/fire",
        "actors/mage/fire"
    ]
}
```
