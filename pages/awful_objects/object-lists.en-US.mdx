# Awful Object Lists

## What are they?

> They're arrays containing awful objects and their expected [attributes](object-attributes) and [functions](object-functions). Each list is filtered based on its own specific criteria, which is described below for each one.

### Performance

> Most lists remain completely empty until referenced. They're generated on-demand by filtering the unlocker's OM, then cached for constant time re-reads the rest of the current 'tick'.

### Freshness

> You must always grab lists fresh where you need them. You can't declare them locally outside of your working scope like you can [static objects](static-objects), or they'll become stale. Generally you'll wanna access them directly from the awful namespace, e.g, `awful.enemies`. Though there are a couple of exceptions where they can be accessed by name directly (like `enemies` or `group`), namely inside the **Routine Actor** and your Spell Object **:Callback** functions.



### Magic Methods

> Object Lists contain several **Magic Methods** which allow you to do powerful searches, iterations, and more with the objects contained. Some examples:
>
> [around](object-lists#around): finds objects from the list that are within a given distance of another awful object
>
> [loop](object-lists#loop): an iteration alternative to standard **for loops**, allowing you to mimic and reap the benefits of a [**continue statement**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/continue-statement-cpp/) to write cleaner, significantly less indented ~~spaghetti~~ code.

> We go over the rest at the end of this section, so stick around.

## Lists

### group

Other players in our party or raid, **not including the player**.

> See also:
>
> **fgroup** | Players in our group, **including the player**. (fullGroup)

- **Everywhere:** Players in your party or raid.

```lua
-- mega basic rejuv
rejuvenation:Callback(function(spell)
    group.loop(function(friend)
        -- guard clause for members who already have rejuv.. ('continue' to next unit in the loop)
        if friend.buffRemains(spell.id, player) > 4 then return end
        -- otherwise rejuv & break loop on successful cast
        return spell:Cast(friend)
    end)
end)
```

### enemies

Contains enemy units that are relevant to the player's current environment.

- **Arena / Battleground:** Enemy players only.

- **PvE / Open World:** Enemy **units** that are in combat or targeting a player, or enemy **players** that are targeting or attacking the player.

- **Table Population:** In regard to the enemy table being populated. Keep in mind that unless explicitly stated otherwise, special mobs like Shades, and other things will be included in the enemies table. There are also specific mobs in certain instances that never have a combat status nor target a player, such as the Phase 2 images of Mueh'zala, these will also be populated in the table.

- **Excluded from enemies:** Explosives, can be found in awful.explosives.

```lua
-- basic corruption maintenance on enemies
awful.enemies.loop(function(enemy)
    -- dbr = debuffRemains
    if enemy.dbr(corruption.id, 'player') < 3 then return end
    return corruption:Cast(enemy)
end)
```

### friends

Contains all friendly players within render distance.

- **Everywhere:** All friendly **players**, even ones that are not in your group. This can be a needlessly large list in the open world.

```lua
-- casting some heal on any friend below 40%
awful.friends.loop(function(friend)
    if not friend.combat or friend.hp > 40 then return end
    return spell:Cast(friend)
end)
```

### dead

Contains all targetable dead units within render distance.

- **Everywhere:** All targetable valid dead units.

```lua
-- casting a battle res on a dead friend
awful.dead.loop(function(unit)
    if not unit.friend then return end
    if not unit.player then return end
    return spell:Cast(unit)
end)
```

### totems

Contains enemy totems or related objects (PvP).

> **tip:** the list of totems and corresponding object IDs that populate this list can be found in `lists.lua` near awful loader.

- **Everywhere:** All enemy totems, psyfiend, banner, etc. Totems flagged as dead or despawning but still visible are automatically filtered out.

```lua
awful.totems.stomp(function(totem, uptime)
    -- only totems that have been up for 300+ms
    if uptime < 0.3 then return end
    -- stomp 'em
    return spell:Cast(totem)
end)
```

### seeds

Contains only living night fae wildseed units.

- **Everywhere:** Living night fae wildseed units. Both friendly and enemy seeds are in the list.

```lua
-- some auto enemy wildseed targeting and stomping!
awful.seeds.track(function(seed, uptime)
    -- only enemy seeds
    if not seed.enemy then return end
    -- auto target it
    if not seed.isUnit(target) then seed.setTarget() end
    -- only seeds that have been up for 300+ms
    if uptime < 0.3 then return end
    -- stomp 'em
    return spell:Cast(seed)
end)
```

### explosives

Contains M+ affix explosive objects, doesn't appear in awful.enemies.

```lua
someSpell:Callback("kill explosives", function(spell)

end)
```

### objects

Contains all objects of type `GameObject`

```lua
-- interact with soulwell
awful.objects.loop(function(obj)
    if obj.name == "Soulwell" then
        obj:interact()
    end
end)

-- find some quest object
local quest_object_id = 123
awful.objects.loop(function(obj)
    if obj.id == quest_object_id then
        print("we found our thingy!")
        return true -- breaks the loop
    end
end)
```

### triggers

Contains all objects of type **area trigger**, both freindly and enemy.

```lua
-- find enemy freezing trap (idk if the ID is correct lol)
awful.triggers.loop(function(trigger)
    -- continue to next object if this one isn't freezing trap
    if trigger.id ~= 187650 then return end

        print("there's a fucking rock attacking me bruv")
    end
end)
```

### imps

### afflicteds

Contains Afflicted units (Mythic+).

## **Magic Methods**

> They're available for **every single awful object list**
>
> You can make them available to a normal indexed array with `awful.immerseOL(table)`
>
> All **Magic Methods** return `true`, so you can weave them into conditional statements if you want

### around

> Find the number of units around a unit or position
>
> You can set specific criteria (filter) they must meet to be added to the count
>
> Receive a new list back with the units around

```lua
local count, total, objects = list.around(unit, distance, criteria)
```

- Parameters:
  - 1. **unit** (awful object) or **position** `{x, y, z}`: **required** - the unit or position to check that objects in the list are around
  - 2. **distance**: `{number}`, **required** - the distance from the given unit/position an object must be within to be added to the count
  - 3. **criteria**: `{function}`, optional - criteria to check against each object before adding them to the **main count** and **objects list**
- Returns:
  - 1. **main count**: `{number}`, the number of units around who met the criteria (if any)
  - 2. **total count**: `{number}`, the total number of units around, even if they did not meet the criteria
  - 3. **objects**: `{array}`, array of objects that were around and met criteria (if any)

Examples:

```lua
-- checking breakable cc around me for brutal slash
local bcc, bsCount = enemies.around(player, 8, function(obj) return obj.bcc end)
-- now we know 0 bcc is around, but we also hit 2 targets with bslash
if bcc == 0 and bsCount >= 2 then
    brutalSlash:Cast()
end

-- checking breakable cc around expected stomp position
local bcc = function(obj) return obj.bcc end

local stompPos = function(unit)
  if not pet.exists then return unit.position() end
  local px,py,pz = pet.position()
  if pet.rooted then return px, py, pz end
  local x,y,z = unit.position()
  local angle = awful.AnglesBetween(x,y,z,px,py,pz)
  local reach = unit.combatReach
  return x + reach * cos(angle), y + reach * sin(angle), z
end

local sx, sy, sz = stompPos(target)
if enemies.around({sx, sy, sz}, 12, bcc) == 0 then
    barbedShot:Cast(target)
end
```

### filter

> The filter method creates a new object list containing all objects that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

```lua
local enemyMelee = enemies.filter(function(obj)
    return obj.role == "melee"
end)

enemyMelee.loop(function(obj)
    -- do stuff with melee objects
end)
```

### loop

> Iterate the object list, calling the provided function for each object.
>
> When any truthy value is returned, the loop will break.

- Function is passed 3 arguments:
  - 1. **object** each object in the list
  - 2. **index** current index in the iteration
  - 3. **uptime** the amount of time since we first iterated over this object (**0** for new object detections)
- Arguably better solution than **for loops** for iterating object lists.
  - Allows you to mimic the functionality of a [continue statement](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/continue-statement-cpp/), an invaluable tool not available to Lua, by simply closing eliminating conditions with a **return**
  - This (on average) reduces code spaghetti by a breathtaking 42.069%.
  - Fr tho, way less indenting. Check the example below.
- Check [best practices - spaghettification](#) for more tips on reducing spaghetti-sauce in your code.
- `forEach` is a valid alternate key for the same method

```lua
-- this code is already over-indented, but it can get way crazier real fast
for _, unit in ipairs(list) do
    if unit.enemy and unit.distance < 40 then
        if not unit.immuneMagic and unit.los then
            if not unit.isUnit(target) then
                if hotStreak or combustion then
                    if not unit.facing(player) then
                        if helpMePlease then
                            if spell:Cast(unit) then
                                awful.alert("Casted the thing!", spell.id)
                                break
                            end
                        end
                    end
                end
            end
        end
    end
end

-- this accomplishes the exact same thing, it's just way easier to work with
-- ...for both the eyes and fingies when we need to move things around!
list.loop(function(unit)
    if not hotStreak and not combustion then return end
    if not unit.enemy or unit.distance > 40 or not unit.los then return end
    if unit.immuneMagic or unit.isUnit(target) then return end
    if unit.facing(player) or not helpMePlease then return end
    return spell:Cast(unit) and awful.alert("Casted the thing!", spell.id)
end)

-- also, has those neat extra features baked in for free :)
awful.friends.loop(function(unit, i, uptime)
    if uptime == 0 then
        print("New unit detected: " .. unit.name .. ", they're a " .. unit.classString)
    end
end)
```

### stomp

> Very similar to `loop`, but with a couple of key differences:
>
> 1.) Eliminates totems that are stuck at 1 hp or in the process of despawning from the iteration.
>
> 2.) Does not give back `index` - only `object` and `uptime`

```lua
awful.totems.stomp(function(totem, uptime)
    if uptime < 0.25 then return end
    if totem.hp < spell.damage * 2 then
        spell:Cast(totem) -- noice!
    end
end)
```

### sort

> Sorts the list using basic Lua `table.sort`
>
> Not very performant, should be used sparingly.

```lua
awful.enemies.sort(function(x,y) return x.hp < y.hp end)
```
## Custom Object Lists

- They contain all other awful object list methods: https://docs.awful.wtf/awful_objects/object-lists#magic-methods
- They only populate themselves when you attempt to read some value in them, like list.loop, list.filter, list[1] etc. Otherwise, they remain empty and do nothing. 
- They're cleared each fw tick just like every other awful object list.

Caveats: 
- Population creates an awful object for every object of type(s) passed, which could be heavy  though awful objects are cached and retrieved by GUID from an associative array, which is constant read time, so i'm thinking it's not a huge concern for CPU time - but might live rent free in your memory sticks.
- Length operator #list will not trigger population of the list, and will not return the correct value. Assuming Lua 5.1 used in WoW doesn't have __len metamethod, and too lazy to check. You can use list.length instead.

awful.List:New(objectTypes, constructor)

```lua
local unlocker, awful, project = ...

-- units (5), players (6)
-- iterates OM objects by types passed, calling your constructor function and passing awful object for each
-- each constructor return of value adds the object to your list
project.dogs = awful.List:New({ 5, 6 }, function(object, objectType, guid)
  -- some blacklist of object ids?
  if object.id and blacklist[object.id] then return end
  return object.class2 == "DRUID" or object.class2 == "WARRIOR" -- a list of warriors and druids idk? :skull: * 7
end)

-- use it like any other awful object list...
project.dogs.loop(function(unit)
  print(unit.name, unit.health)
end)
```
Object Types

```lua
Object = 0,
Item = 1,
Container = 2,
AzeriteEmpoweredItem = 3,
AzeriteItem = 4,
Unit = 5,
Player = 6,
ActivePlayer = 7,
GameObject = 8,
DynamicObject = 9,
Corpse = 10,
AreaTrigger = 11,
SceneObject = 12,
ConversationData = 13
```
